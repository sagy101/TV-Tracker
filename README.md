## Demo

Experience TrackTV without installation via my online demo:

[Live Demo TBD](https://tv-tracker-demo.herokuapp.com/) • [Demo Video TBD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=demo)

---

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- **MongoDB (v4.4 or higher)**: Required only if you plan to run a *local* MongoDB instance. Not needed if using MongoDB Atlas (cloud).
- npm or yarn
- An email sending service (e.g., Mailtrap for testing, SendGrid/Gmail for production)

### Quick Install

**Windows Automated Setup:**

For Windows users, you can use the provided setup scripts (`setup.bat` or `setup.ps1`) to automate the installation process.

- **PowerShell (Recommended):**
  1. Open PowerShell as Administrator.
  2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd path\to\tv-tracker`
  3. Allow script execution (if needed): `Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope Process`
  4. Run the script: `.\setup.ps1`

- **Command Prompt (Batch):**
  1. Open Command Prompt as Administrator.
  2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd path\to\tv-tracker`
  3. Run the script: `setup.bat`

**Note:** These scripts will attempt to install Node.js (via nvm-windows) and MongoDB locally, configure them using `mongod.cfg`, install project dependencies, and set up the `.env` file with a default `MONGODB_URI` pointing to the *local* MongoDB instance. You can switch to MongoDB Atlas later by editing the `MONGODB_URI` in the generated `.env` file (see `.env` details below).

**Manual Installation (All Platforms):**

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/sagy101/tv-tracker.git
cd tv-tracker

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Set up environment variables (See details below)
cp .env.example .env

# Ensure your database is ready (local MongoDB running or Atlas URI configured in .env)

# Start the development servers (in separate terminals)
# Terminal 1: Start the backend server
npm run server

# Terminal 2: Start the frontend client
npm start
```

<details>
<summary><strong>.env Variable Details (Click to expand)</strong></summary>

*   **Edit the `.env` file** created in the previous step (or by the setup scripts).
*   **REQUIRED:**
    *   `MONGODB_URI`: Your MongoDB connection string.
        *   **For MongoDB Atlas (Cloud - Recommended):** Use the `mongodb+srv://...` string provided by Atlas, replacing `<db_password>` with your database user password. Example: `mongodb+srv://user:<password>@cluster-name.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=YourApp`
        *   **For Local MongoDB:** Use the standard connection string format. Example: `mongodb://localhost:27017/tv-tracker` (This is the default set by the setup scripts).
    *   `EMAIL_USER`: Username for your email sending service (e.g., Mailtrap).
    *   `EMAIL_PASS`: Password for your email sending service.
    *   `JWT_SECRET`: A long, random, secure string for signing tokens. (Generate one via: `node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"` )
*   **Optional / Defaults:**
    *   `EMAIL_HOST` / `EMAIL_PORT`: Defaults are set for Mailtrap (check `.env.example`).
    *   `JWT_EXPIRES_IN`: Token lifetime (defaults to `90d`).
    *   `NODE_ENV`: Set to `development` or `production`.
*   **Local MongoDB Setup Only:** (These are primarily used by the setup scripts and the local `mongod.cfg`. Not needed when using Atlas `MONGODB_URI`)
    *   `MONGODB_DATA_DIR`: Path where the local MongoDB instance stores its data files.
    *   `MONGODB_LOG_DIR`: Path where the local MongoDB instance writes its log files.
*   **Recommendation:** For `EMAIL_*` variables during development, using Mailtrap is recommended.
    *   See Mailtrap's Getting Started Guide: [https://help.mailtrap.io/article/10-getting-started-with-mailtrap-email-sandbox](https://help.mailtrap.io/article/10-getting-started-with-mailtrap-email-sandbox)
