## Code of Conduct

I am committed to providing a welcoming and inclusive experience for everyone. By participating in this project, you agree to abide by my Code of Conduct.

In short: Be respectful, considerate, and constructive in all interactions. Harassment, discrimination, and disruptive behavior are not tolerated.

## Getting Started

### Development Environment

1. Fork the repository
2. Clone your fork: `git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/tv-tracker.git`
3. Add the upstream repository: `git remote add upstream https://github.com/sagy101/tv-tracker.git`
4. Install dependencies: `npm install`
5. Set up your development environment following the instructions in [DEVELOPMENT.md](./DEVELOPMENT.md)

### Finding Issues to Work On

- Check the [Issues](https://github.com/sagy101/tv-tracker/issues) tab for open tasks
- Look for issues labeled `good first issue` if you're new to the project
- Issues labeled `help wanted` are actively seeking contributors
- Comment on an issue to express your interest before starting work

---

## Contribution Workflow

### Branch Naming Convention

Use the following format for branch names:

- `feature/short-description` - For new features
- `bugfix/issue-description` - For bug fixes
- `docs/what-changed` - For documentation updates
- `refactor/component-name` - For code refactoring
- `test/what-tested` - For adding or updating tests

Example: `feature/import-export`

<details>
<summary><strong>Commit Message Guidelines</strong> (click to expand)</summary>

I follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

```
<type>(<scope>): <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

Types:
- `feat`: A new feature
- `fix`: A bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Changes that don't affect code functionality (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code changes that neither fix bugs nor add features
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Changes to build process, dependencies, etc.

Examples:
- `feat(import): add CSV import functionality`
- `fix(episodes): fix episode sorting issue`
- `docs(readme): update installation instructions`
</details>

### Pull Request Process

1. Update your local repository: `git fetch upstream`
2. Create a new branch from the latest main: `git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature upstream/main`
3. Make your changes, committing regularly with meaningful messages
4. Push your changes to your fork: `git push origin feature/amazing-feature`
5. Create a Pull Request via the GitHub interface
6. Update your PR based on feedback until it's approved and merged

### Code Review Process

All submissions require review before being merged. The review process includes:

1. Automated checks (CI/CD, linting, tests)
2. Code review by at least one maintainer
3. Possible request for changes or additional information
4. Approval and merge by a maintainer

- Run existing tests to ensure your changes don't break anything: `npm test`
- Write both unit and integration tests when applicable

### Documentation

- Update documentation to reflect your changes
- Add JSDoc comments to functions and components
- Update the README.md if necessary
- Create or update [documentation](./docs) for major features

## Release Process

1. Maintainers will periodically create releases from the main branch
2. Version numbers follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)
3. A changelog is maintained via [CHANGELOG.md](../CHANGELOG.md)
4. Release notes detail new features, bug fixes, and breaking changes
